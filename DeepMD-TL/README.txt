**Contents**
	ALL-KRAKEN -- KRAKEN toolkit, provides support for calculating sound transmission losses
	xx.env -- Environmental documents, describing parameters such as sound speed profiles and number of sampling points. The parameter settings are the same as Figure 13 in the paper. The SSPs estimated using different methods are saved in this file. The parameters of the mixed layer and sedimentary layer are consistent.
	xx.flp -- Input file for sound field parameters, including parameters such as maximum distance and sound source depth. The parameter settings are the same as Figure 13 in the paper and for all methods these parameters are the same.
